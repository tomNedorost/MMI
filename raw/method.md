**STUDY: Acceptance of Nomadic Virtual Reality**
As already mentioned VR devices represent a potential upcoming alternative to conventional screens in the mobile context. The specific target of this study was to examine more about the current state of social acceptance in the open field by confronting unprepared pedestrians with this topic in different real life scenarios. This was done with the help of a field study because of our hypothesis that the procedure under laboratory conditions will have another result due to emotional distances.

**Study Design**
The design of the study was a two-factorial within-subject design and conducted with the help of the three independent variables GENDER, WEARING OF VR-GOGGLES and PERFORMING GESTURES. The usage of VR devices does not only include the actual wearing of the goggles. Gesture control with the help of connected VR controllers is essential for the use of VR devices of any kind. Since performing those gestures might have a big impact on the acceptance this also was a very important issue to test to find out more about the general acceptance and how people react when beeing contfronted with this situation. It is also important to investigate whether the gender of the wearer has an influence on the results or not.

**Stimuli**
In earlier researches pictures and videoclips have been used for probing [1]. Since we wanted to extend those results and test their external validity we used confrontations in real life situations in the open field rather than representations of it. The first important stimuli was the gender. We wanted to find out if the gender itself plays an important role with the acceptance of such devices in general. Both genders have been tested without using any VR tools to get a baseline for upcoming steps and procedures. Another stimuli we used was the fact that both our actor and our actress will wear a VR goggle to test its influence on the pedestrians. Last but not least we tested the goggles in combination with controllers and gesture controls which is our final stimuli. In this study we combined those three stimuli to receive as much information as possible about peoples reactions on different types of situations.

**Survey Procedure**
After handing out the informed consent, the randomly chosen participants obtained a short demographic questionaire in which we request allegations to gender, age and job. Afterwards we handed out another Questionaire to measure the acceptability of wearable devices [2]. The socalled WEAR Scale is a questionaire that consists of several items to finde out how acceptable a device is with regard to e.g. asthetic itself, the wearers charisma it awakes and the own attitude towards the gadget. Subsequent each participant received a little thank-you gift.

**Participants**
Because this study has not been researched under laboratory conditions it was not possible to recruit test persons. Another reason for us to not hire subjects was, that this would have not lead to the result we were looking for. We wanted to examine this Acceptance Rating by collection real life reactions and the opinions they might bear on. For this type of field study it was essential to blindside pedestrians in their daily life to receive an unbiased output.
